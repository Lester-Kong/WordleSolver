# WordleSolver
WordleSolver is a program that is capable of helping you with your wordle game. 
The program will recommend a word. Upon doing so, it will immediately ask for the result. Type
in the result in the form of a 5 letter word consisting of y's, w's, or g's.
Each letter will correspond to the result of the game with y representing yellow partial
letters, w representing wrong letters, and g representing green correct letters.
The program will end when entering "ggggg".
